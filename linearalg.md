## Equations In Two Variables

1. Consider an eqation $x+2y=4$
2. This represents a line in the x-y plane.
3. Consider another equation $3x+4y=5$.
4. This represents another line in the x-y plane.

These equations can we represented as a matrix multiplication.

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
5
\end{bmatrix}
\]
