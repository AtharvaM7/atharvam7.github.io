Astronomy is not about telescopes.  
Computer Science is not about computers.  
Mathematics is not about numbers.

## Equations In Two Variables

1. Consider an eqation $x+2y=4$
2. This represents a line in the x-y plane.
3. Consider another equation $3x+4y=5$.
4. This represents another line in the x-y plane.

These equations can we represented as a matrix multiplication.

$$ x+2y=4 $$
$$ 3x+4y=5 $$
