Astronomy is not about telescopes.  
Computer Science is not about computers.  
Mathematics is not about numbers.

## Equations In Two Variables

1. Consider an eqation $x+2y=4$
2. This represents a line in the x-y plane.
3. Consider another equation $3x+4y=5$.
4. This represents another line in the x-y plane.

These equations can we represented as a matrix multiplication.

$$ x+2y=4 $$
$$ 3x+4y=5 $$

## Git testing beyond this
 
1. Commit from vim. That did not work.
2. Trying to pull (from the terminal) hence this commit from the website.
3. Pull worked. This edit is from pc.
4. Back to commit from vim.
5. This edit is to test if i can pull from vim. Hence this commit from the website.
6. :!git pull worked, but I had to reopen vim for it to reappear. (retry pull)
7. This is getting a little messy. But now I am playing with branches. Update this commit in the "Merge_This_To_The_Main_Branch" and then merge it with the main branch.
